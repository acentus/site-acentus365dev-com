          <p>
              Note: This is an abbreviated version of the supplier standards every Medicare DMEPOS supplier must meet in order to obtain and
              retain their billing privileges. These standards, in their entirety, are listed in 42 C.F.R. 424.57(c). 
          </p>
        </div>
        <ul class="n">
          <li>
            A supplier must be in compliance with all applicable Federal and State licensure and regulatory requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must provide complete and accurate information on the DMEPOS supplier application. Any changes to this
            information must be reported to the National Supplier Clearinghouse within 30 days.

          <li>
            A supplier must have an authorized individual (whose signature is binding) sign the enrollment application for billing
            privileges.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must fill orders from its own inventory, or contract with other companies for the purchase of items necessary to fill
            orders. A supplier may not contract with any entity that is currently excluded from the Medicare program, any State health
            care programs, or any other Federal procurement or non-procurement programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must advise beneficiaries that they may rent or purchase inexpensive or routinely purchased durable medical
            equipment, and of the purchase option for capped rental equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must notify beneficiaries of warranty coverage and honor all warranties under applicable State law, and repair or

          <li>
            A supplier must maintain a physical facility on an appropriate site and must maintain a visible sign with posted hours of
            operation. The location must be accessible to the public and staffed during posted hours of business. The location must be at
            least 200 square feet and contain space for storing records.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must permit CMS or its agents to conduct on-site inspections to ascertain the supplier’s compliance with these
            standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must maintain a primary business telephone listed under the name of the business in a local directory or a toll free
            number available through directory assistance. The exclusive use of a beeper, answering machine, answering service or cell
            phone during posted business hours is prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must have comprehensive liability insurance in the amount of at least $300,000 that covers both the supplier’s place
            of business and all customers and employees of the supplier. If the supplier manufactures its own items, this insurance must
            also cover product liability and completed operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier is prohibited from direct solicitation to Medicare beneficiaries. For complete details on this prohibition see 42 CFR
            § 424.57 (c) (11).
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier is responsible for delivery of and must instruct beneficiaries on the use of Medicare covered items, and maintain
            proof of delivery and beneficiary instruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must answer questions and respond to complaints of beneficiaries, and maintain documentation of such contacts.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must maintain and replace at no charge or repair cost either directly, or through a service contract with another
            company, any Medicare-covered items it has rented to beneficiaries.

          <li>
            A supplier must accept returns of substandard (less than full quality for the particular item) or unsuitable items (inappropriate

          </li>
          <li>            
            A supplier must disclose these standards to each beneficiary it supplies a Medicare-covered item.
          </li>
          <li>

            Medicare billing number.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must have a complaint resolution protocol established to address beneficiary complaints that relate to these
            standards. A record of these complaints must be maintained at the physical facility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complaint records must include: the name, address, telephone number and health insurance claim number of the beneficiary, a
            summary of the complaint, and any actions taken to resolve it.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must agree to furnish CMS any information required by the Medicare statute and regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            All suppliers must be accredited by a CMS-approved accreditation organization in order to receive and retain a supplier billing
            number. The accreditation must indicate the specific products and services, for which the supplier is accredited in order for the
            supplier to receive payment for those specific products and services (except for certain exempt pharmaceuticals).
          </li>
          <li>
            All suppliers must notify their accreditation organization when a new DMEPOS location is opened.
          </li>
          <li>
            All supplier locations, whether owned or subcontracted, must meet the DMEPOS quality standards and be separately accredited
            in order to bill Medicare.
          </li>
          <li>
            All suppliers must disclose upon enrollment all products and services, including the addition of new product lines for which
            they are seeking accreditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must meet the surety bond requirements specified in 42 CFR § 424.57 (d).
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must obtain oxygen from a state-licensed oxygen supplier.
          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must maintain ordering and referring documentation consistent with provisions found in 42 CFR § 424.516(f).
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            A supplier must remain open to the public for a minimum of 30 hours per week except physicians (as defined in section 1848(j)
