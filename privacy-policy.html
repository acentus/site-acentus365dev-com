              <li>
                <strong>WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:</strong>
                <p>
                    a. Treatment means the provision, coordination or management of your health care, including
                    consultations between health care providers regarding your care and referrals for health care from
                    one health care provider to another. For example, your primary care physician assigned by your
                    health insurance carrier, who coordinates all of your general health care, may need to know your
                    history of urinary tract infections which is maintained by your urologist. Therefore, your primary
                    care physician (PCP) may review your medical records to assess whether you have potentially
                    complicating conditions and to appropriately order treatment and medical supplies.
                    b. Payment. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose your identifiable health information in order to bill and
                    collect payment for the items you receive from us. For example, we may contact your health insurer
                    to certify that you are eligible for benefits (and for what range of benefits), and we may provide your
                    insurer with details regarding your treatment to determine if your insurer will cover, or pay for, your
                    medical supplies. We also may use and disclose your identifiable health information to obtain
                    payment from third parties that may be responsible for such costs. Also, we may use your
                    identifiable health information to bill you directly for items.
                    c. Health Care Operations means the support functions of our business related to treatment and
                    payment, such as quality assurance activities, case management, receiving and responding to
                    complaints, compliance programs, audits, and other administrative activities. For example, we may
                    use your medical information to evaluate the performance of our staff in providing service to you
                    and other business planning activities.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>DISCLOSURE AND USE OF YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES</strong>
                <p>
                  a. Disclosures Required by Law. <strong>Acentus</strong> will use and disclose your identifiable health information
                  when we are required to do so by federal, state or local law.
                  b. Health Oversight Activities. <strong>Acentus</strong> may disclose your identifiable health information to a health
                  oversight agency for activities authorized by law. Oversight activities can include, for example,
                  investigations, inspections, audits, surveys, licensure and disciplinary actions; civil,, administrative,
                  and criminal procedures or actions; or other activities necessary for the government to monitor
                  government programs, compliance with civil rights laws and the health care system in general.
                  c. Lawsuits and Similar Proceedings. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose your identifiable health
                  information in response to a court or administrative orders, if you are involved in a lawsuit or
                  similar proceeding. We also may disclose your identifiable health information in response to a
                  discovery request, subpoena, or other lawful process by another party involved in the dispute, but
                  only if we have made an effort to inform you of the request or to obtain an order protecting the
                  information the party has requested.
                  d. Workers’ Compensation. <strong>Acentus</strong> may release your identifiable health information for workers’
                  compensation and similar programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shipment Reminders. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a
                  reminder that you need to confirm or authorize shipment of your monthly medical supply order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Product Alternatives. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose medical information to inform you about or
                  recommend possible medical supply options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Health-Related Benefits and Services. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose medical information to tell you
                  about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care. <strong>Acentus</strong> may release medical
                  information about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care. We may
                  also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. We may also tell your family or
                  friends your condition and that you are in the hospital. In addition, we may disclose medical
                  information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be
                  notified about your condition, status and location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Research. Under certain circumstances, <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose medical information about
                  you for research purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and
                  recovery of all patients who utilized one medical management methodology to those who utilized
                  another, for the same condition. All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval
                  process. This process evaluates a proposed research project and its use of medical information,
                  trying to balance the research needs with patients' need for privacy of their medical information.
                  Before we use or disclose medical information for research, the project will have been approved
                  through this research approval process, but we may, however, disclose medical information about
                  you to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to help them look for patients
                  with specific medical needs, so long as the medical information they review does not leave the
                  facility. We will almost always ask for your specific permission if the researcher will have access to
                  your name, address or other information that reveals who you are, or will be involved in your care
                  at the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety. <strong>Acentus</strong> may use and disclose medical information
                  about you when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and
                  safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to
                  help prevent the threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Military and Veterans. If you are a member of the armed forces, <strong>Acentus</strong> may release medical
                  information about you as required by military command authorities. We may also release medical
                  information about foreign military personnel to the appropriate foreign military authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Public Health Risks. <strong>Acentus</strong> may disclose medical information about you for public health
                  activities. These activities generally include the following: to prevent or control disease, injury or
                  disability; to report births and deaths; to report child abuse or neglect; to report reactions to
                  medications or problems with products; to notify people of recalls of products they may be using; to
                  notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or
                  spreading a disease or condition; to notify the appropriate government authority if we believe a
                  patient has been the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. We will only make this disclosure
                  if you agree or when required or authorized by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Law Enforcement. <strong>Acentus</strong> may release medical information if asked to do so by a law enforcement
                  official: In response to a court order, subpoena, warrant, summons or similar process; to identify or
                  locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person; about the victim of a crime if, under
                  certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain the person's agreement; about a death we
                  believe may be the result of criminal conduct; about criminal conduct at the hospital; and in
                  emergency circumstances to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the identity,
                  description or location of the person who committed the crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inmates. If you are an inmate of a correctional institution or under the custody of a law
                  enforcement official, <strong>Acentus</strong> may release medical information about you to the correctional
                  institution or law enforcement official. This release would be necessary (1) for the institution to
                  provide you with health care; (2) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of others;
                  or (3) for the safety and security of the correctional institution.

                <p>
                  You have the following rights regarding the identifiable health information that we maintain about
                  you:

                    <li>
                      Confidential Communications. You have the right to request that <strong>Acentus</strong> communicate with
                      you about your health and related issues in a particular manner or at a certain location. For
                      instance, you may ask that we contact you at home, rather than work. In order to request a
                      confidential communication, please specify the requested method of contact, or the location
                      where you wish to be contacted. <strong>Acentus</strong> will accommodate reasonable requests. You do no
                      need to give a reason for your request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Requesting Restrictions. You have the right to request a restriction in our use or
                      disclosure of your identifiable health information for treatment, payment or health care
                      operations. Additionally, you have the right to request that we limit our disclosure or your
                      identifiable health information to individuals involved in your care or the payment for your
                      care, such as family members and friends. We are not required to agree to our request;
                      however, if we do agree, we are bound by our agreement except when otherwise required by
                      law. In order to request a restriction in our use or disclosure of your identifiable health
                      information, you must make your request in writing to <strong>Acentus</strong>. Your request must describe
                      in a clear and concise fashion: (a) the information you wish restricted; (b) whether you are
                      requesting to limit our company’s use, disclosure or both; and (c) to whom you want the
                      limits to apply.

                      Inspection and Copies. You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of the identifiable
                      health information that may be used to make decisions about you, including patient medical

                    <li>
                      Amendment. You may ask us to amend your health information if you believe it is

                      disclosures”. An “accounting of disclosures” is a list of certain disclosures <strong>Acentus</strong> has made
                      of your identifiable health information. In order to obtain an accounting of disclosures, you
                      must submit your request in writing to the <strong>Acentus</strong> Compliance Officer. All requests for an
                      “accounting of disclosures” must state a time period which may not be longer than six years
                      and may not include dates before December 01, 2003. The first list you request within 12
                      months is free of charge, but <strong>Acentus</strong> may charge you for additional lists within the same 12
                      month period. <strong>Acentus</strong> will notify you of the costs involved with additional requests, and you
                      may withdraw your request before you incur any costs.
